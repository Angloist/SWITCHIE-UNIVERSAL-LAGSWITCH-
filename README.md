the reason why itll show many positives, is because you have to RUN IT AS ADMIN (virus total dosent like that), and it turns off and on your INTERNET + HAS A KEYBIND. 

(heres a chatgpt summary because im 2 lazy and sped to write it out) 
The lag switch isn’t a virus.
VirusTotal shows a few warnings only because the program turns your internet adapter off and on to create lag.

Some antiviruses think this behavior might be harmful because real malware can also mess with your network.
So they mark it as “suspicious,” even though the file has no virus, no hidden code, and does nothing except toggle your internet for a split second.

It’s just a false positive caused by:

A new/unsigned EXE

Network adapter control

Heuristic antivirus engines guessing wrong

Over 80% of scanners mark it clean.
The warnings don’t mean it’s dangerous — just that the tool does something antivirus programs don’t fully understand.
